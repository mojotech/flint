# Python tests

## Overview
This directory contains the code to test the Python code. It uses the `unittest` module.

## Prerequisites
The tests need a spark distribution installed locally to run. An easy way to do it is to go to the
[Apache Spark download page](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) and select version 2.1.1 (May 02 2017), Pre-built for Apache Hadoop 2.7 and later.

Extract the tarball in a local directory and set the following environment variable:
```
export SPARK_HOME=<local-spark-directory>
```
One time preparation for running the python tests can be setup by runinning the following
from the root Flint directory:
```
scripts/prepare_python_tests.sh
```

## Running tests
To run the tests issue the following command from the root Flint directory:
```
scripts/run_python_tests.sh
```

## Code
The code for the tests is found in this `tests` directory. The content of the files here is as follows:

* `base_test_case.py` Contains code for the `BaseTestCase` abstract class that is the grandfather of all the testcases.
* `spark_test_case.py` Contains a concrete class, `SparkTestCase`, that inherits from `BaseTestCase` and sets up a local `SparkContext`. This is the default class to inherit test cases from.
* `test_dataframe.py` Contains about 50 test cases for the `TimeSeriesDataFrame`.
* `test_data.py` Contains constant data for the tests.
* `utils.py` Contains specialized assert functions and Pandas DataFrame creation.

## Extending
If the test setup done in the default class, `SparkTestCase`, does not fit the needs of a particular environment, a new class can be written. The name of the new class, say `MyTestCase` is then exported in the `BASE_CLASS` variable before the tests are run:
```
export FLINT_BASE_TESTCASE=<Name of new class>
```
